## RNA Binding Protein Visualization Project

This project involves recreating visualizations using fictitious data of genomic annotations and RNA binding protein signals. The project is divided into two exercises, each requiring the generation of specific figures based on provided datasets.

**Visualization Exercise 1:**

The task is to recreate three alternative visualizations of the same artificial data, representing fictitious genomic annotations alongside RNA binding protein signals. These visualizations demonstrate RNA binding protein signals over genomic annotations.

Datasets:
10_project_data_annotations.csv: Fictitious genomic information, visualized as transcripts with exons (grey rectangles) on DNA strands.
10_project_data_signals.csv: Fictitious signals of four RNA binding proteins (P1, P2, P3, P4).

**Visualization Exercise 2:**

This task involves creating a multi-panel figure, incorporating the bottom portion of one of the solutions from Exercise 1. Two additional plots (scatter plot and bar plot) are also required.

Datasets:
10_project_data_scatter.csv: Data needed to create a scatter plot.
10_project_data_barplot.csv: Data required to create a bar plot.
10_project_data_annotations.csv: Used again for the genomic annotations in the bottom panel.
10_project_data_signals.csv: RNA binding protein signal data for the bottom panel.
Goals:

Recreate three different visualizations showing genomic annotations and RNA binding protein signals.
Create a multi-panel figure by adding scatter and bar plots to one of the visualizations from Exercise 1.
